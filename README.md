# Movie-Recommendation-System
This is a content-based movie recommendation system built with Streamlit. It takes a movie name as input and suggests similar movies by analyzing genres, keywords, cast, and director using TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity. The dataset and similarity matrix are preprocessed and stored with pickle for quick access during runtime.
